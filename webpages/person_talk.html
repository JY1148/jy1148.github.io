								<h2>Stress</h2>
								<p>It is unavoidable to say that it is my keynote of the recent life. For Five months, now. Anxiety and Pressure. It comes upon every moment I am sober (Sometimes it disguised as nightmare). The internship is really hard to find. The timing is hard, and as an individual, I have to brave this situation with the same body, using of which I enjoyed joy of life.</p>
								<p>I told myself, and Julay, one year ago that the following period would be the hardest time for us ever. I thought it would be a time for me to grow with adversity. But the truth is a time to suffer with unexpected psychological negative mood. I even felt the depression came. And fortunately went away. But not rainy does not equalize sunny. Cloudy always.</p>
								<h2>Is there any good news?</h2>
								<p>I have to say that I grew up a lot. Now my body can suffer more anxiety. Even though this is simply triggered by a really small thing: searching internship. But this shallow life experience really gives out deep agony, which can also prove that I was not strong enough to better handle such 
									negligible stuff.</p>
								<p>Starting from scratch, I learned programming in Java, Python and JavaScript in school and beyond campus(Thank you, the Internet). I could be the emblem of best utilizing the web to learn knowledge. I have a strange conviction that I must have better learning strategy and skill than others because I taught how to learn.</p>
								<p>I built projects. Watching videos and following step by step. Every time I had an aha moment paves my way to progress. I really love aha moment. I really really enjoy having aha moment. It triggers dopamine. It makes me happy.</p>
								<p>Now I have a relatively good understading of full stack. From database to API, from CRUD to routing system, from auth and authz to web deployment, I enjoy learning new things. I hope this would continue until I am strong enough.</p>
								<h2>Staying negative</h2>
								<p>Honestly, I dont like this murmuring. I stay outgoing in my image most of the time. And I must be super embarrassed in the future when I turned back and read this shit. I hope life could be simpler, more foci on development and creating new value.</p>
								<p>That is how I work. That is how life works. Wish you Good Luck! Joe.</p>
