								<h2>Teacher</h2>
								<p>I love my job. I love teaching. I also love many things. I think I love everything. It would be normal for me to do something I am qualified. By doing, I harvest fulfillment.</p>
								<p>And it would be normal for me to add my personal favor/label into my work. I have thoughts and ideas. It is unavoidable. Because I have thoughts about my job and my normal life. There must be some ways that I can weave things together and make brilliant things. I know me really much. It never disappoints me.</p>
								<p>So when I worked as an English teacher in southern China, I feel great great comfortable. Your class is your automony. You are welcome and encouraged to fill your class with your personal idea. Students also enjoy it if the idea is great. So I really love making things great. That is a positive feedback. Even until now, I can still savor the great class that I have once presented.(sounds weird and a bit narcissistic?..)</p>
								<p>So when I switch to another career path, which is software engineering, I feel confident. I really love coding. The positive feedback of the dead cold machine is super high. And when you have your idea and if you can realize it on your own by just tapping the keyboard and making the computer run as you wish, that was really cool, especially in those eyes who doesnt know anything about coding. Awesome, man!</p>
								<h2>Why I switch?</h2>
								<p>Teacher has never been an easy job. It is not about you cannot do well. It is about you can always be diverted by other non-educational business. Imgaine a professor without TA. A professor checking attendence and homework of over 100 students and 2 classes each day and still have to attend meetings and participate in the school and community building. The workload is tremendous. I have fewer focus on creativity and present myself more. (BTW, I still have creativity time under such workload but I crave for more).</p>
								<p>So my thought is, how to help all teachers out of the dilemma. Without a good balance, high quality teaching would be hard to continue. From history, I know it is the time for the wheels(the productivity)!</p>
								<p>Wheels saved labor and technology will save teaching as well. If we teach today as we taught yesterday, we rob our children of tomorrow. John Deway taught me to keep my eyes on the future. And I saw computer technolgy.</p>
								<h2>How about today?</h2>
								<p>I am always retrospecting myself. I saw my footprints from the past. I jumped into the education field. I found big room for creating new method of illuminating kids. And my educational experience guided me to the current field. Now I am in the computer engineering. When I asked me why, I found that my footprints are the dots of the passion for creativity.</p>
								<p> My grandfather is a mechanical engineer. My father is an electrical engineer. They gave me the gene of love making stuff. And I would be a software engineer.</p>
